## Introduction
üìçThis repository provides tools and analyses for gaining insights into the Road Accidents of year 2001-2020.It insights the cause, time, and place of the accident. The following points outline the key functionalities of this tool:

## Performance Comparison 
 üöÄ **Compare:** Analysis the time and place (states in India) when most and least accidents occured.
 
 üöÄ **Historical Data:** Evaluate past road accidents on historical data for more informed about the occurance.
 
 üöÄ **Seasonal Impact:** Analyze the role played by each month of the year in determining the least and most accidents.
 
 üöÄ **Daily Deviation:** Investigate the deviation between the day time and night time of accidents on a daily basis.

## Why Use This Tool? 
üìä With thousands of daily accidents happening, controling can be challenging. Many individuals have faced losses due to road accidents. This tool aims to empower the control of road accidents and analysis which state cause most accidents.

## Power BI for Data Visualization 
üìà This project utilizes Power BI, a powerful data visualization tool developed by Microsoft. Power BI enables users to connect to various data sources, create interactive reports and dashboards, and derive meaningful insights. With its intuitive interface and robust analytical capabilities, Power BI is an ideal choice for visualizing and understanding complex datasets, making it an invaluable asset in the field of data analysis.
